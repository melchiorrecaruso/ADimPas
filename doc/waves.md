# Waves and Hearing

### Wave speed on a stretched string

$v = \displaystyle\sqrt{\frac{F_T}{\mu}}$ ,

where 

- $F_T$ is the tension in the string, $[N]$, 
- $\mu$ is the mass per length of the string, $[kg/m]$.

### Periodic waves speed

$v = \displaystyle\lambda⋅f$ ,

where

- $\lambda$ is the wave length, $[m]$,
- $f$ is the wave frequency, $[Hz]$.

### Sinusoidal wave function

$y(x,t)=A⋅sin(k⋅x±\omega ⋅t + \phi)$ ,

where
- $A$ is the value of wave amplitude,
- $k=\displaystyle\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, $[rad/m]$,
- $x$ is the position, $[m]$,
- $ω=\displaystyle {2\pi}/{T}$ is the angular frequency, $[rad/s]$, 
- $T=\displaystyle 1/f$, is the wave period, $[s]$,
- $t$ is the time, $[s]$,
- $\phi$ is the wave phase, $[rad]$.

### Beat (acoustics)

$f_{beat} = |f_1-f_2|$ ,

where
- $f_{beat}$ is the beat frequency, $[Hz]$,
- $f_1$ is the frequency of wave 1, $[Hz]$,
- $f_2$ is the frequency of wave 2, $[Hz]$.
