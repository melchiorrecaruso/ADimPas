# Waves and Hearing

### Wave speed on a stretched string

$v = \displaystyle\sqrt{\frac{F_T}{\mu}}$ ,

where 

- $F_T$ is the tension in the string, $[N]$;
- $\mu$ is the mass per length of the string, $[kg/m]$.

### Periodic waves speed

$v = \displaystyle\lambda⋅f$ ,

where

- $\lambda$ is the wave length, $[m]$;
- $f$ is the wave frequency, $[Hz]$.

### Sinusoidal wave function

$y(x,t)=A⋅sin(k⋅x±\omega ⋅t + \phi)$ ,

where
- $A$ is the value of wave amplitude;
- $k=\displaystyle\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, $[rad/m]$;
- $x$ is the position, $[m]$;
- $ω=\displaystyle {2\pi}/{T}$ is the angular frequency, $[rad/s]$;
- $T=\displaystyle 1/f$, is the wave period, $[s]$;
- $t$ is the time, $[s]$;
- $\phi$ is the wave phase, $[rad]$.

### Beat (acoustics)

$f_{beat} = |f_1-f_2|$ ,

where
- $f_{beat}$ is the beat frequency, $[Hz]$;
- $f_1$ is the frequency of wave 1, $[Hz]$;
- $f_2$ is the frequency of wave 2, $[Hz]$.

### Doppler effect

$f_{observed} = \displaystyle f_0⋅\left(\frac{c±v_r}{c±v_s}\right)$ ,

where

- $f_{observed}$ is the observed frequency, $[Hz]$;
- $f_0$  emitted frequency, $[Hz]$;
- $c$ is the propagation speed of waves in the medium, $[m/s]$;
- $v_r$  is the speed of the receiver relative to the medium, added to $c$ if the receiver is moving towards the source, subtracted if the receiver is moving away from the source, $[m/s]$;
- $v_s$ is the speed of the source relative to the medium, added to $c$ if the source is moving away from the receiver, subtracted if the source is moving towards the receiver, $[m/s]$.
