# Relativity

### Speed of light in vacuum

$c_0=\displaystyle \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0·\mu_0}}$ ,

where

- $c_0$ is the speed of light, $299$ $792$ $458$ $[m/s]$;
- $\epsilon_0$ is the electric permittivity, $[F/m]$;
- $\mu_0$ is the magnetic permeability, $[H/m]$.

### Lorentz factor

$\gamma=\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$ ,

where

- $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor;
- $v^2$ is the relative velocity between inertial reference frames, $[m/s]$;
- $c^2$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $299$ $792$ $458$ $[m/s]$;
- $\beta$ is the ratio of $v$ to $c$.

### The Lorentz trasformation

$x'=\displaystyle\frac{x-vt}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$ ,

$t'=\displaystyle\frac{t-\frac{v·x}{c^2}}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$ ,

where

- $x'$ is the x position in the moving reference frame, $[m]$;
- $x$ is the x position in the fixed reference frame, $[m]$;
- $v$ is the velocity in the x direction with respect to the fixed reference frame.
- $t'$ is the 



### Length Contraction 

$L=\displaystyle L_0·\sqrt{1-\beta^2}=\frac{L_o }{\gamma}$ ,

where

- $L_0$ is the length measured in the moving reference frame, $[m]$;
- $L$ is the length measured in the fixed reference frame, $[m]$.

 ### Time dilation

 $T=\displaystyle\frac{T_0}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}=\gamma·T_0$ ,

 where

 - $T_0$ is the time interval measured in the moving reference frame, $[s]$;
 - $T$ is the time interval measured in the fixed reference frame, $[s]$.

### Relativistic mass

$m=\displaystyle\frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}=\gamma·m_0$ ,

where

- $m$ is the increare in "effective mass" with speed, $[kg]$;
- $m_0$ is the rest mass, $[kg]$.

### Energy-mass relationship

$E=m·c^2$ ,

where

- $m$ is the effective mass, $[kg]$;
- $c$ is the speed of light, $[m/s]$.
