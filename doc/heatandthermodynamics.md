# Heat and Thermodynamics

### Linear thermal expansion

$ΔL = L_0·(λ·ΔT$) ,

where

- $L_0$ is the initial length, $[m]$, 
- $λ$ is the lienar coefficient of thermal expansion, $[1/K]$, 
- $ΔT$ is the difference of the temperature between the two recorded strains, $[K]$.

### Heat capacity

$Q = (m·c)·ΔT$ ,

where 

- $m$ is the mass of body, $[kg]$,
- $c$ is the specific heat capacity, $[J/(kg·K)]$,
- $ΔT$ is the change in temperature, $[K]$.

### Calorimeter equation

$m_1·c_1·(T_e-T_1) = m_2·c_2·(T_2-T_e)$ ,

where

- $m_1$ is the mass of body 1, $[kg]$,
- $m_2$ is the mass of body 2, $[kg]$,
- $c_1$ is specific heat capacity of body 1, $[J/(kg·K)]$,
- $c_2$ is specific heat capacity of body 2, $[J/(kg·K)]$,
- $T_1$ is the initial temperature of body 1, $[K]$,
- $T_2$ is the initial temperature of body 2, $[K]$,
- $T_e$ is the final temperature of bodies, $[K]$.

### Heat conduction

$Q̇ = [k·(ΔT/L)]·A$ ,

where 

- $k$ is the material's conductivity, $[W/(m·K)]$,
- $ΔT$ is the temperature difference between the ends, $[K]$,
- $L$  is the distance between the ends, $[m]$,
- $A$ is the cross-sectional surface area, $[m^2]$.

### Heat convection

$Q̇ = [h·(T-T_f)]·A$ , 

where

- $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient, $[W/(m^2·K)]$,
- $T$ T is the object's surface temperature, $[K]$,
- $T_f$ T is the fluid temperature, $[K]$,
- $A$ is the area of the object, $[m^2]$.

### Thermal radiation

$Q = (ε·σ·T^4)·A$ ,

where 

- $ε$ is the surcafe emissivity factor, a dimensionless number,
- $σ$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, $[W/(m^2·K^4)]$,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature of the body, $[K]$, 
- $A$ is the surface area of the body. $[m^2]$.

### Ideal gas law:

$p·V = (n·R)·T$ , 

where

- $p$ is the pressure, $[Pa]$,
- $V$ is the volume, $[m^3]$,
- $n$ is the amount of substance, $[mol]$,
- $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $R = 8.314$ $[J/(mol·K)]$,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature of the gas, $[K]$.
