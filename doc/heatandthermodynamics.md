# Heat and Thermodynamics

### Linear thermal expansion

$ΔL = L_0·(λ·ΔT$) ,

where

- $L_0$ is the initial length, $[m]$, 
- $λ$ is the lienar coefficient of thermal expansion, $[1/K]$, 
- $ΔT$ is the difference of the temperature between the two recorded strains, $[K]$.


### Heat capacity

$Q = (m·c)·ΔT$ ,

where 

- $m$ is the mass of body, $[kg]$,
- $c$ is the specific heat capacity, $[J/(kg·K)]$,
- $ΔT$ is the change in temperature, $[K]$.

### Heat conduction

$Q̇ = [k·(ΔT/L)]·A$ ,

where 

- $k$ is the material's conductivity, $[W/(m·K)]$,
- $ΔT$ is the temperature difference between the ends, $[K]$,
- $L$  is the distance between the ends, $[m]$,
- $A$ is the cross-sectional surface area, $[m^2]$.

### Heat convection

$Q̇ = [h·(T-T_f)]·A$ , 

where

- $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient, $[W/(m^2·K)]$,
- $T$ T is the object's surface temperature, $[K]$,
- $T_f$ T is the fluid temperature, $[K]$,
- $A$ is the area of the object, $[m^2]$.

### Thermal radiation

$Q = (ε·σ·T^4)·A$ ,

where 

- $ε$ is the surcafe emissivity factor, a dimensionless number,
- $σ$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, $[W/(m^2·K^4)]$,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature of the body, $[K]$, 
- $A$ is the surface area of the body. $[m^2]$.

### Ideal gas law:

$p·V = (n·R)·T$ , 

where

- $p$ is the pressure, $[Pa]$,
- $V$ is the volume, $[m^3]$,
- $n$ is the amount of substance, $[mol]$,
- $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $R = 8.314$ $[J/(mol·K)]$,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature of the gas, $[K]$.

### Displacement current

$i_d = \epsilon_0⋅\displaystyle\left(\frac{\Delta\Phi_E}{\Delta t}\right)$ ,

where

- $i_d$ is the Maxwell's Displacement current, $[A]$, 
- $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $[C^2/N/m^2]$,
- $\Delta\Phi_E$ is the change in electric flux, $[V⋅m]$,
- $\Delta t$ is the change in time, $[s]$.
